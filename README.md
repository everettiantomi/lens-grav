# Gravitational lensing.
We study the effects of plasma in the strong gravitational lensing regime. We take a numerical and perturbative approach.
For the numerical approach we use version 1.9.1 of [lenstronomy](https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy). **WARNING**: profiles used here may not work on older versions.
