# Gravitational lensing.
We study the effects of plasma in the strong gravitational lensing regime. We take a numerical and perturbative approach.
For the numerical approach we use version 1.9.1 of [lenstronomy](https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy). **WARNING**: lens profiles used here do not work on older versions.

## Profile instalation

To add profiles to the lenstronomy package the file
*anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/lenstronomy/LensModel/profile_list_base.py*
should be modified on lines 32 and 150. Syntax should be clear by context.
